It will bring forth your energy and makes you motivated to do anything that you were meant to do today. You might think what the heck am I doing, but once you listen to this 1-hour long chorus, it will direct you to the light, clear your mind, and guide you to what you are meant to do today. Usagi will be your savior in desperate times once you immersed in his melodic singing. You will suddenly feel light as if all the weight is lifted from your shoulder and then shall your mind be direct with you. If you read this far, apologies for this jibberish. May you be bless forever and never. May you be cleared of stress and confusion.",

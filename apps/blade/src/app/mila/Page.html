          <p>
            Hello! I'm Mila Knickerbocker. I'm majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Environmental Studies at the 
            University of Central Florida, and expect to graduate in May of 2027 with a Bachelors of Science. I have been 
            honing my skills in computer science with programs such as Python, C and Java, and getting involved in the 
            schoolâ€™s community through organizations such as Central Florida Rowing, where I implement the skills of 
            cooperation and discipline that I developed as a team captain and rowing coach. Prior to UCF, I held several 
            positions, where I learned a lot about the different styles of communication. While working as a Babysitter and 
            Pet Caretaker, I was also involved in several clubs, such as the Engineering Club, where I participated in 
            competitions that required a strong line of communication between teammates along with the ability to 
            problem-solve in high stress environments. I went on to win both events I competed in. I was drawn to Computer 
            Science because of my love for math and Environmental Studies from my passion for environmentalism and 
            sustainability. Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. I look forward to connecting with you!

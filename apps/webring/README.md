2. fork this repo and add your information to the *BOTTOM* of `WEBRING_MEMBERS` in `packages/consts/src/webring-members.ts` following this format

```ts

            "name": "Your Name",
            "year": "Graduation Year",
            "website": "Website/Linkedin/Github",
            "image": "Image of yourself, placed in /public/name.jpg",
            "role": "Any role / position you held at KH. member counts!",
